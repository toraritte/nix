This chapter shows you how  to write **Nix expressions**, which instruct
Nix how to build  packages that will be stored in  the **Nix store**. It
starts with a simple example (a Nix expression for
[GNU Hello](https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/)),
and then moves on to a more in-depth look at the **Nix expression language**.

> **Note**
> 
> This  chapter   is  mostly   about  the  **Nix   expression  language**.
> For   more   extensive   information   on   adding   packages   to   the
> [**Nix   Packages  collection**](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs)   (or
> [**Nixpkgs**](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs)  for   short),  such  as
> functions  in the  standard environment  and coding  conventions, please
> consult [its manual](http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/).
